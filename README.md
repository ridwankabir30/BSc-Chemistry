# DFT Optimization and Vibrational Analysis of Fluorescein

This project focuses on the geometry optimization and vibrational frequency analysis of fluorescein using DFT (B3LYP/6-31+G(d)) with Gaussian 16.

### Objectives:
- Perform full geometry optimization in gas phase
- Identify key vibrational modes, especially in 1500–1800 cm⁻¹ range
- Generate IR spectrum from Gaussian output
- Visualize structure and interpret key modes

### Tools Used:
- Gaussian 16
- Chemcraft for molecular orbital visualization
- Python (NumPy, matplotlib) for IR plotting

> Data generated as part of final year BSc Chemistry project under Dr. Elena Piletska & Prof. Sergey Piletsky.
